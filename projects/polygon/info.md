# polygon

GOAL: create a VR experience to edit polygons


x create an app that loads onto device & shows a cube
x get dots showing up in 3D space
x be able to move dots around
x be able to remove dots
x be able to connect dots with lines
x be able to connect 3 dots with line to create triangle
	x can only do triangles in Mesh/MeshFilter
x triangles can have culled surface/normal
x select multiple vertexes/triangles at a time to move them
x show some display menu (on/off) at user hand

- buttons & different interactions

- press different colors on display menu to change mesh color


- save/load polygon data locally

/


- apply different textures to triangles/polygon
	=> material

- create textures at runtime
	- change surface properties, like:
		- color
		- shinyness
		- ...







- how to 'unwrap' polygon across a texture
	- uv mapping
